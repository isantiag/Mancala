## Game Idea
The objective of the game is to collect the most marbles in his/her store (also known as Mancala) by the end of the game. 
The game begins with one player picking up all of the marbles in any one of the pits on his/her side.
Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the marbles in each pit until the marbles run out.
If you run into your own store, deposit one marble in it. If you run into your opponet's store, skip it and continue moving to next pit.
If the last marble you drop in your own store, you take another turn.
If the last marble you drop is an empty pit on your side, you capture that marble and any marble in the opposite pit and place in your store. 
If the last marble you drop is not either one condition above, next player turns.
The game ends when all six pits on one side of Mancala board are empty.
The player who still has marbles on his/her side of the board when the game ends captures all of those marbles.
The winner is the player with the most marbles.

## MVP Goals
Build Mancala bord using HTML element and basic styling with CSS. After that build a functional javascript representing the quantity of marbles by numbers. Display the player turn, player score and the game result.

## Stretch Goals
My first stretch goal was to replace the representation of the quantity of marbles from numbers to image.

## Any roadblocks
Time limitation - I needed to use the time wisely since my kids were in vacation and I needed to give attention to them.
