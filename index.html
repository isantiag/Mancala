                    This game supports one or two players. When the webpage is loaded, two players are considered by default. In case you want
                    to select one player, please click "1Player" on the header of the webpage. In any time, the game is changed from 1player to 2players
                    or vise-versa, the players scores are clear. The program supports up to 12 marbles in each individual pit.
                    The pits from player 1 is in the top of the board, while for player2/computer is in the botton. Note that store for player 1 is on 
                    the left and for player2/computer is on right side.
                    The player chooses one of the pits in his/her side. The program automatically updated the number of marbles following the rules below:
                    If you run into your own store, one marble is deposited in your store. 
                    If you run into your opponet"s store, skip it and continue moving to next pit.
                    If the last marble you drop in your own store, you take another turn.
                    If the last marble you drop is an empty pit on your side, you capture that marble and any marble in the opposite pit and place in your store. 
                    If the last marble you drop is not either one condition above, next player turns.
                    The game ends when all six pits on one side of Mancala board are empty.
                    The player who still has marbles on his/her side of the board when the game ends captures all of those marbles.
                    The winner is the player with the most marbles.
